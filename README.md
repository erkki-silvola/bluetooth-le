# bluetooth-le
C++ bluetooth le library

First version will be ready hopefully 1.5.2015. First version will have iOS/Mac support for CoreBluetooth, with both xcode project file 
and Qt project file. I hope that first version would have Linux support (BlueZ). 2nd Version sometime in summer should have Android and win 8
support. I will allso start making Host stack , which can be used through USB serialport. If you have any idea's / suggestions send me mail.
